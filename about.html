        <h1>How was this game made?</h1>
        <p>Pretty simple. actually. shower thoughts came to true. I just thought this'll be cool to make.
            With a couple of simple HTML, CSS, and JS, this way pretty easy to make.
            <sub>Also a bit of help from ChatGPT, but we don't talk about that...</sub>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Was there any difficulties?</h1>
        <p>Well, sort of. CSS started acting a bit too weird today, so that was pretty difficult to take care of.
            <sub>That's why I used ChatGPT...</sub>

        <h1>Is this project special to you?</h1>
        <p>It actually is, somehow. This was my first ever project with proper HTML, CSS, and JS all combined. So I guess
            you can call this the only proper project I made so far.
